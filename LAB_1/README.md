# Lab 1
1. I used the command `git clone` 
2. I used the command `git log` hash of the previous commit 026a090324377506906cf3d37c5d05790e04a0d6
3. I used the command `git checkout -b branch` 
4. I made all the changes on the branch, so the changes on the master branch are not displayed
5. The error occurred because different data were in the same place
6. There are no changes on the local version,  is a command for synchronization `git pull`
